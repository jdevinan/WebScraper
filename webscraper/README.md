webscraper
===========

*webscraper* is a console application, which can scrape through the Sainsburyâ€™s Fruit Product offerings Web Page and prints out a JSON object.
JSON object contains following two fields:
	1). The first Object contains the "total" field, which contains the sum of the "unit prices" of individual products on the Web page.  
	2). The second object contains the "JSON Array", which contains the complete details of all the product offerings on the web page.

This solution is implemented with the spirit of MVC (Model View Controller) design pattern. But, please observe that this application is only console based and does not contain any special GUI (Graphical User Interface). But, the GUI module can be 
implemented and plugged to this project seamlessly.

Source code package structure:
------------------------------
Project's source code is organised into different Java packages to reflect the 
MVC design paradigm.

NOTE: Database layer can be added easily by adding any JPA implementation (e.g. Hibernate or Spring-Data etc..).


Dependencies
------------
*webscraper* depends on following frameworks:

1). "json-simple" - for JSON data manipulation. (NOTE: "jackson" library can replace this)
2). "jsoup" - for connecting to the Web page and for extraction of data by parsing HTML tags.
3). "junit" - for implementing automated Unit Tests.
